======================

PHP library for easily integrating with the AWeber API.

Changelog:
----------

2011-08-25: v1.1.0
 * Modified client library to raise an APIException on any API errors (HTTP status >= 400)


Basic Usage:
------------
Refer to demo.php to see a working example of how to authenticate an app and query the API.

For more complete documentation please refer to:
https://labs.aweber.com/docs/php-library-walkthrough


Handling Errors:
----------------
Sometimes errors happen and your application should handle them appropriately.
Whenever an API error occurs an APIException will be raised with a detailed 
error message and documentation link to explain whats wrong.

You should wrap any calls to the API in a try/except block.

Common Errors:
 * Resource not found (404 error)
 * Your application has been rate limited (403 error)
 * Bad request (400 error)
 * API Temporarily unavailable (503 error)

Example Below:

<?php

$consumerKey = '***';
$consumerSecret = '***';
$accessKey = '***';
$accessSecret = '***';

$aweber = new AWeberAPI($consumerKey, $consumerSecret);
$account = $aweber->getAccount($accessKey, $accessSecret);

try {
    $resource = $account->loadFromUrl('/accounts/idontexist');
} catch (APIException $exc) {
    print "<li> $exc->type on $exc->url, refer to $exc->message for more info ...<br>";
}

?>
